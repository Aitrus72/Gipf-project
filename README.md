Training a neural network to play the board game Gipf

David Sprehn and Espen Nielsen
March 2018

This is a work in progress!
We haven't yet completed training of an AI that can play well.

Goal: we wanted to learn about neural networks and their AI applications,
  so we decided to try training one to play the board game Gipf. 
Neither of us knows how to play the game well -- an intentional choice
  because we are really excited about the potential for this sort of 
  technology to generate new knowledge, so we decided to avoid using any 
  preexisting strategy heuristics or information about the game for
  training the AI.  It will learn entirely from self-play.
